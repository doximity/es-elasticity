 - Better automatic index name and document type
v0.7.1
	- add more response info to raised exceptions from reindexing
v0.6.5
	- update search and multi search interfaces to allow passing of general

	- update multi search `[]` method to raise an exception with key name to
	make it easier to debug failed queries within a multi search hash.
v0.6.0
	- Change documents to be able to define indexes with multiple doc types.  A
	Document class can define subclasses which are of different doc_types and

	- updated search queries to pass either a list of document types or a single
	document type.
	- Update documents to generate a default document_type from the class name
	so that Documents always have a document type. You'll still usually want to
	manually define the document type, but it's no longer necessary.

  Search::Results object which proxies array and is enumerable.
